# Bitly Backend Engineer Coding Challenge Requirements
# 
# This file contains the Python dependencies required to run the click counter solution.
# All dependencies are part of Python's standard library, so no external packages are needed.

# Python Standard Library Modules Used:
# - csv: For parsing CSV files
# - json: For parsing JSON files
# - logging: For structured logging
# - collections: For defaultdict
# - datetime: For timestamp parsing
# - typing: For type hints
# - sys: For system operations
# - os: For file system operations
# - unittest: For unit testing
# - tempfile: For creating temporary test files

# No external dependencies required!
# Python 3.7+ recommended for optimal type hint support
